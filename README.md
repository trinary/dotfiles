# My dotfiles!

## Summary

I mostly use this to transfer changes between two computers that I commonly write code on.  The install script is probably way out of date because I've only ever had to run it twice. :) 

My setup ends up being symliks from ~/ to a clone of this repo, so things get updated by doing a git pull and reloading/sourcing the new files.

Hope you find some interesting stuff in here.  I'm switching from zsh to fish, and have some catching up to do there.
